University coding poject from my short time in Engineering. Simple Indiana Jones type of game, where you look to collect treasure (+ Symbol), while plugging holes (* Symbol) by pushing boulders (O Symbol). As the player (X Symbol), you try to collect all the treasures before escaping through the gap in the wall.
